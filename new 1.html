<h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do <em class="intro">you</em> want?</h2>
 <p><em class="intro">You</em> probably build websites and think your shit is special. <em class="intro">You</em> think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get <em class="intro">you</em> some fucking Awwward banner <em class="intro">you</em> can glue to the top corner of your site. <em class="intro">You</em> think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if <em class="intro">you</em> had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
        
        <p><em class="intro">You</em>. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking website. Why the fuck do <em class="intro">you</em> need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? <em class="intro">You</em> spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.</p>
        
        <p><em class="intro">You</em> never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>It's fucking lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did <em class="intro">you</em> seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so <em class="intro">you</em> could animate the fucking background color of a div? <em class="intro">You</em> loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so <em class="intro">you</em> could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? <em class="intro">You</em> piece of shit.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p><em class="intro">You</em> dumbass. <em class="intro">You</em> thought <em class="intro">you</em> needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if <em class="intro">you</em>'re on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>It fucking works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this shit. <em class="intro">You</em> can read it ... that is, if <em class="intro">you</em> can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so <em class="intro">you</em> and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but <em class="intro">you</em> spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare <em class="intro">you</em>.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it.  <em class="intro">You</em>'ve never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, <em class="intro">you</em> have no fucking idea what a website is. All <em class="intro">you</em> have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, <em class="intro">you</em> fuck</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. <em class="intro">You</em> break them. <em class="intro">You</em> son-of-a-bitch.</p>
